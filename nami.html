                Hi Nami, I hope you have a nice Birthday and eat lots of good food! Anyways, I just wanted to say that I'm glad
                that I got the chance to meet you. I really enjoy our late night calls and your stupid, dark humor...

                I remember the first time I slid into your dms asking you to duo queue LOL. My clan was making
                so many jokes about be simping but oh well... it worked out haha. I'm still shook that we actually started
                talking.

                Thank you for always supporting me. It's been a rough couple of weeks for me with midterms and stuff
                but it's really sweet of you to keep me company while I do my work. This screenshot was from the night
                I was up until 7 am finishing a problem set. Spain but the S is silent :(

                I'm also a meme now around 3SNS thanks to you. LOL oops. But I did clap the people we were scrimming against
                so now its our ritual to have everyones name end in nami.
